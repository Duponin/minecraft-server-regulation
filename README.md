# Minecraft Server Regulation

This software is meant to regulate minecraft server for automated tasks as reboot with several tasks to be done in a certain order.

It relies on [MSCS]{https://github.com/MinecraftServerControl/mscs} for server management and [Skript]{https://github.com/SkriptLang/Skript} for command management.
