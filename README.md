# Minecraft Server Regulation

This software is meant to regulate minecraft server for automated tasks as reboot with several tasks to be done in a certain order.

It relies on [MSCS](https://github.com/MinecraftServerControl/mscs) for server management and [Skript](https://github.com/SkriptLang/Skript) for command management.


## How it should works

1. Send a command to Skript
2. Wait for command completion
3. Shutdown the servers
4. Backup
5. Update server config
6. Start the servers

Execution relies on a Cron rule.

Errors are handled at any moments. AÂ mail is send with all the information needed (and available).

## Config file

Config is stored into the `config.cfg` file.
